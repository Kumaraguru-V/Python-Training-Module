What is a variable?**\n","\n","<p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A variable is a label we assign to the data in the coding. As the name suggests the data of the variable keeps varying. Hence the need for a label which remains same to identify these data becomes relevant. For example, in our football tournamnet, there is a requirement for the parking lot entry be automated. When a car drives at the entrance of the parking lot, the driver needs to enter the license number. The system then dispenses a slip with the license number and time stamp. After collecting the slip the car may enter the parking lot.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Check the code cell below to better understand the concept. The license number entered by the driver is given a label name as <B>License_Number</B>. This label name or variable is the name of the address which stores the data. So we can use this address to instruct the computer to access the data. This can be visualized in the print() function below, where the variable <B>License_Number</B> actually prints the data stored in it.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"dAXebU2Fk4LQ"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Car Entry Point:\n","import time as t\n","License_Number=input('Enter License Number:')\n","print('License Number:',License_Number)\n","print('Entry Time:',t.ctime())\n","print('Please collect your slip')"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"edmIvBlzowtD","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1712831508397,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":4336,"user":{"displayName":"Kumaraguru V","userId":"03767465563479516483"}},"outputId":"f76a4dbb-fc57-4124-f6f3-e5cb488337e8"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Enter License Number:abcd1234\n","License Number: abcd1234\n","Entry Time: Thu Apr 11 10:31:48 2024\n","Please Collect your slip\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["---\n","## **5.2. Rules for Variables in Python**\n","\n","<p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Python, variables are used to store data values. Here are some key rules for naming variables in Python:\n","\n","* **Valid Characters:** Variable names can contain letters (a-z, A-Z), digits (0-9), and underscores (_). They must start with a letter or an underscore.\n","\n","* **Case-Sensitivity:** Python is case-sensitive, so variables with different capitalization are considered different. For example, myVar, myvar, and MYVAR are three distinct variables.\n","\n","* **Reserved Keywords:** Python has reserved words that cannot be used as variable names because they are used for language syntax. Examples include if, else, for, while, def, class, import, True, False, etc. We'll learn about keywords in the next module.\n","\n","* **No Special Characters:** Variable names cannot contain special characters such as @, $, %, *, etc., except for the underscore (_) character.\n","\n","* **Length:** Variable names can be of any length, but meaningful and descriptive names are recommended for readability.\n","\n","* **Naming Convention:** It's a convention in Python to use lowercase letters for variable names. For multi-word variable names, the convention is to use underscores to separate words (my_variable_name). This is called snake_case.\n","\n","<p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If these rules aren't followed, python returns error while running the code.

These are coding entities that makes the coding more logical and simple. We'll learn about these in the next module. As of now, you can copy these snippets into code cells and see how they work. Also try modifying the variable names and values.
