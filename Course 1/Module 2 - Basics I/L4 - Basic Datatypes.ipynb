Errors in Python:\n"," <p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Generally, your computer doesn't know how to mix different data types. For example, adding two integers together makes perfect sense to computers, like this: print(7+8) 15 Adding together two strings also makes sense: print(\"hello \" + \"world\") We just end up with the longer strings that contain the two, like so: hello world but your computer doesn't know how to add an integer and a string. If you tell it to mix these two different data types: print(7 + \"8\") your computer isn't going to know what to do and will raise an error. Check it out: TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'int' and \"str' Oh, no, our first error, but don't panic. Errors are a common part of programming, and you'll probably have to deal with them a lot. The trick is to think of errors as little clues from your computer to help you improve your programming skills. Read the errors carefully, understand what they're telling you, and then use that new knowledge to help you fix the mistake. In this example, the last line of the error message shows us that we've encountered something called a TypeError. Then we get a bit of explanatory text, that tells us that the plus sign can't be used between an int type and an str type, which are short names for integer and string. Thinking about what we've already learned about strings, integers, and mixing data types, can you guess what the error is trying to tell us? The message unsupported operand type, tells us that we can't add the integer seven and the string eight, because they're different data types, but what if you didn't have an instructor to helpfully point that out? How would you know? You'd need to use your research skills and the resources we called out earlier in the course to do some investigating. For example, you could look for information about the error by pasting the TypeError message into the search bar of your favorite search engine. This is a common trick used by almost everyone learning to code, and even by experienced developers. You'll usually find that other people on the Internet have reported similar errors and solved them too. Back to our example. Maybe you're thinking, aren't we adding two numbers here? Looks a bit like it, right? Well, look carefully and remember that anything wrapped in quotation marks is considered a string in Python. So eight is a string here: \"8\" while seven is an integer. To the computer, adding seven plus eight is just as strange as adding seven plus A is to us, and seven plus A equals no sense at all."],"metadata":{"id":"8hG4wdvC4y-v"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["---\n","## **4.4.
