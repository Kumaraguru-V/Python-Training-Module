Jupyter/Python environment\n","\n","<p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An easy way to contemplate Jupyter/Python environment is to relate with a football game. To conduct a game we need players and obviously a field to play the game. The field can also be used to play other games or as a makeshift concert hall. During the game, there is video replay to confirm that there is no foulplay and to cherish the iconic moments at a closer view. To organise a tournament a stadium is built around the field with spectator arena, parking area, dressing rooms, practice fields, offices and other facilities. To facilitate full enjoyment during the tournament several permanent and seasonal businesses like hotels, restaurants, merchandise shops, food & beverage stalls open up around the stadium.</p>\n","<p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, in a Jupyter/Python environment, Python attributes to the players, and it is operated in Jupyter notebook a web-based application, which is the field. The field can be used to play other games than football, where the rules will be different. Likewise, other programming languages can also be used in Jupyter notebook. Like concerts, notebooks can also be used as a text editor to create a narrative or simply a book, without involving any coding language. To check the correctness or the output of the code, there is live execution built-in within the jupyter notebook environment like video-replay. Then there is a bigger structure called JupyterLab, which again is a web-based application in which we can open, organize, and work on files of various types akin to a stadium. And finally, Python is enriched by an extraordinary amount of modules and packages that allow us to add useful functionalities to code like the businesses around the stadium.</p>\n","<p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of now, don't overthink about modules and packages, since a game can run even without the businesses around the stadium. Now let's see how to install the Jupyter/Python environment in your system.</p>\n"],"metadata":{"id":"b5sIDQ4kY8BA"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## 2.2. Installing the Jupyter/Python environment\n","\n","<p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To streamline the installation of JupyterLab, Jupyter Notebook, Python, and associated scientific packages, you can opt for Anaconda, a widely utilized distribution tailored for scientific computing. Begin by visiting the Anaconda website using the link below.</p>\n","\n","[Click here to download Anaconda](https://anaconda.com/download)\n","\n","<p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on your operating system initiate the download process. This may take a few minutes. Upon completion, install Anaconda following the typical software installation steps — click 'Next' when prompted and adhere to default options unless specific requirements dictate otherwise. The installation process may also take a few minutes. Once Anaconda is successfully installed, access the Anaconda Navigator by double-clicking its icon (Fig.1.1). Upon opening the Navigator, you'll find a comprehensive suite of software within Anaconda, including JupyterLab (Fig. 1.2), Jupyter Notebook (Fig. 1.3) and Spyder (Fig. 1.4). In this course, we will code in Python using JupyterLab as a working environment. So let's learn how to use it!</p>\n","\n","<figure>\n","    <img src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1mX1tkxHoyYdq0xpoB2L5QbPwR_kNAD99\">\n","    <figcaption>Figure 1: Anaconda UI -  (1) icon; (2) JupyterLab; (3) Jupyter Notebook; (4) Spyder; and (5) JupyterLab launch button.</figcaption><br>\n","</figure>\n","\n","<I>For enlarged images click --></I> [Anaconda UI](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1mX1tkxHoyYdq0xpoB2L5QbPwR_kNAD99)<br>\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"PXUIDLarmcGu"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## 2.3. JupyterLab\n","\n","<p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;JupyterLab provides an organized and efficient coding environment, and is accessed by clicking the Launch button (Fig. 1.5) in the JupyterLab panel in Anaconda. Upon opening, the interface will resemble the figure. Key features of JupyterLab and optimal utilization suggestions are outlined below for a more effective coding experience.</p>\n","\n","* <I>JupyterLab is a web-based environment.</I> When you launch JupyterLab, the first thing you'll notice is that it starts in the browser. However, its address contains localhost, which means that you are actually working locally, that is, on your computer. In other words, you do not need to be connected to the internet to use JupyterLab.\n","* <I>Topbar.</I> The items in the top bar, such as File, Edit, View, etc., are quite intuitive and similar to many other software. We will describe the most relevant items throughout the book, but go ahead and start exploring them! For now, just notice that when clicking some top bar buttons (for example, File), some of the items that appear might be light gray because they are disabled (for example, Save As..). This is because they refer to Jupyter Notebook, which we will open in the next section. Finally, a cool feature of JupyterLab is that you can set a dark theme. If you want that, go to Settings, then JupyterLab themes, and click on JupyterLab Dark.\n","* <I>Browsing and opening files.</I> On the left side of JupyterLab, you can find a panel with some vertical tabs. The first tab contains an icon representing a folder, and, for now, we will focus only on this one. The folder tab opens a panel on its right, which contains a few features. The first is a top bar, containing a symbol, +, which allows us to start a launcher; an icon representing a folder containing a +, to create a new folder; a vertical arrow pointing up, to upload a new file; and a circular arrow, to refresh the content of the current directory—in coding, we often say directory instead of folder. Right below, there is a box to search for files. Then, there is the path of the working directory, i.e., the folder where we are currently opening and saving files. And below, there is a list of the directory content. In JupyterLab, you can open an existing file only from this panel, and not by double-clicking the file in your computer folder. Therefore, you need to know how to navigate folders from JupyterLab. To go back to a previous folder, click on a folder name in the address bar. To go into a sub-folder—a folder in the current folder—just double-click on the sub-folder listed in the folder panel. Last thing: when clicking on the folder icon, the whole file browser panel toggles out, meaning it disappears. When re-clicking, the whole panel toggles back in, so it reappears. Toggling out can be convenient if you have a small screen.\n","* <I>Launching tools.</I> The launcher is the place where you can open new notebooks,consoles,terminals, text files, etc. As an alternative, you can open new files and tools from the top bar by clicking on File, then New, and then selecting the file type you want. It's timeto open a Jupyter Notebook.\n","\n","<figure>\n","    <img src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=18AatxPyn5X-BRWnCu3D7tN8PtQmcb80R\">\n","    <figcaption>Figure 2: JupyterLab UI (1) local URL, (2) top bar, (3) lateral tabs, (4) folder browser top bar, (5) folder browser, (6) folder content, (7) launcher, and (8) Jupyter Notebook launch button.</figcaption><br>\n","</figure>\n","\n","<I>For enlarged images click --></I> [JupyterLab UI](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=18AatxPyn5X-BRWnCu3D7tN8PtQmcb80R)<br>"],"metadata":{"id":"AxzWfF8aqgbD"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## 2.4.
