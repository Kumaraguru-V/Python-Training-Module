Computer Programming\n","\n","<p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Programming is largely about instructing a computer. An individual must compose instructions that computers can comprehend and it is generally called a code. In order to do this, we need to adopt a different mindset. We have to begin from the scratch and become proficient in a new mode of communication, consisting of concise and logical instructions. In practical terms, we need to acquire knowledge in at least three areas: a coding environment, language syntax, and computational thinking. Let's delve into what each of these entails!</p>\n","\n","### <I>1.1.1. Coding Environment</I>\n","<p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A coding environment refers to a program that facilitates the writing and execution of code. Multiple environments are available for Python coding, and in this course, we will specifically utilize the Jupyter/Python environment (see Fig. 1a). Since its introduction in 2015, this environment has gained significant traction in both industry and academia. It excels in seamlessly integrating code with narrative, making it well-suited for tasks such as creating reports, drafting code, and supporting coding education. Integrated development environments (IDEs) are another prevalent category of coding environments. Notable Python IDEs include PyCharm, Visual Studio, Spyder (see Fig. 1b), etc. IDEs typically incorporate various elements such as a script editor, a panel for managing variables, and a console for testing and executing code. And finally, the most basic environment is the Python IDLE, which is included in the Python installation. It consists of a shellâ€”which looks very similar to a terminal (a black screen in which we give instructions to a computer in a specified language or syntax), where one can type and execute commands (see Fig. 1c). </p>\n","\n","<figure>\n","    <img src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1-WJuNNeK3m0KoZcW1VT4C_qyd__lJLO9\">\n","    <figcaption>Figure 1a: Snippet of Jupyter notebook environment</figcaption><br>\n","    <img src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1ekKLaT1kKx4vBvE8gqtSGCZCOl9pN616\">\n","    <figcaption>Figure 1b: Snippet of Spyder IDE</figcaption><br>\n","    <img src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1fMAjfDcQUlpXRFH3RDCFcaNOgWoHvxya\">\n","    <figcaption>Figure 1c: Snippet of Python IDLE</figcaption><br>\n","</figure>\n","\n","<I>For enlarged images click --></I> [Jupyter Notebook](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1-WJuNNeK3m0KoZcW1VT4C_qyd__lJLO9) [Spyder IDE](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1ekKLaT1kKx4vBvE8gqtSGCZCOl9pN616) [Python IDLE](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1fMAjfDcQUlpXRFH3RDCFcaNOgWoHvxya)<br><br>\n","\n","### <I>1.1.2. Language Syntax</I>\n","Language syntax refers to a set of rules governing the structure of commands. You are already well-versed in one syntax, namely your native language syntax. In your mother tongue, you understand words, punctuation, and how to organize these elements into sentences, paragraphs, and complete texts. Coding follows a similar pattern. Familiarity with data types, operators, and the arrangement of these components in constructs like if/else statements and loops is essential for creating functions and classes. Table 1 provides a schematic overview of the elements and syntax covered in this course. Fret not! If the content seems complex at this point, rest assured that clarity will gradually emerge as we advance through the course. Afterall, learning, understanding and being able to chose correct syntax to solve a problem with the help of computational thinking is the objective of this course.</p>\n","\n","<p align=\"justify\"><font color='orange'>Table 1: Components of a programming language are arranged in a spectrum from the most basic on the left to the most complex on the right.

Computational Thinking</I>\n","<p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Computational thinking, integral to coding, involves learning how to approach and think about new subjects. This book will help you develop specific skills, including:</p>\n","\n","* <I>Creating algorithms:</I> Implementing sequential instructions to solve problems.\n","* <I>Divide and conquer:</I> Breaking down problems into sub-problems and combining solutions.\n","* <I>Pattern recognition:</I> Identifying similarities in new problems to apply known solutions.\n","* <I>Solution generalization:</I> Extending solutions from specific cases to broader situations.</p>\n","\n"," <p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As is the case for any subject developing a way of thinking comes with studying and practicing exercises. Thus, thinking computationally comes with learning syntax and practicing computer coding. We will start building these abilities soon in the upcoming lessons. In the next lesson, <b><I>Getting ready</I></b>, you will download, install, and learn how to use the Jupyter/Python environment. But before that, lets see a brief introduction to python.</p>\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"ByV2G_8jlQtF"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## 1.2. What is Python?\n","\n","<p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that we know what is a language syntax and understand that it can be relatively compared to our natural languages. But there are numerous languages spoken across the world, each with unique alphabets, puntuations, vocabulary and grammar. Similarly, since the invention of computers many developers have contributed to create programming languages for different applications and problem domains with unique syntax, semantics and grammar. Some of the famous programming languages are C, C++, Python, JavaScript, Ruby, etc., among many others.</p>\n","\n","<p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Python is a great general-purpose programming language on its own, but with the help of a few popular libraries (add-ons) like numpy, scipy and matplotlib it becomes a powerful environment for scientific computing. Python has gained unparalleled popularity in the programming landscape due to its simplicity, versatility, and community support. Its clear and readable syntax makes it accessible for beginners, enabling them to focus on problem-solving rather than grappling with complex syntax rules. Python's versatility is evident in its applicability across various domains, including web development, data science, artificial intelligence, and automation. The extensive standard library and third-party packages contribute to its widespread adoption, allowing developers to leverage existing resources efficiently. Furthermore, Python's strong community support fosters collaboration, knowledge-sharing, and continuous improvement, making it an ideal choice for both novice and experienced programmers. Its broad usage and ease of learning have positioned Python as a go-to language for diverse applications, fueling its prominence in the programming world. Now that we know what is programming and python, our next step is to get some hands-on as a motivation to this learning experience.</p><br>\n","\n","<p align='center'>Buckle up!
