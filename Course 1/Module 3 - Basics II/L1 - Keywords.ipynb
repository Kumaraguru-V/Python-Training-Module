Built-in Methods/Functions**\n","\n","<p align=\"justify\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Built-in methods in Python are pre-defined functions that are available for use with built-in data types and objects. These methods provide convenient ways to perform various operations on data without having to write custom functions. Some built-in functions are relevant to one or more datatyes but not for all. There are numerous built-in functions in python which makes our job easier, but getting to know them and to exploit them comes with practice.
